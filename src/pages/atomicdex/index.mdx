# Introduction to AtomicDEX

Welcome to the AtomicDEX technical documentation.

#### About the AtomicDEX Section

This documentation is intended for developers utilizing the AtomicDEX API.

#### Conceptual Overview

A brief conceptual overview of AtomicDEX can be found in the <b>Start Here</b> > <b>Product Introductions</b> > <b>AtomicDEX </b> section.

[<b>Link to "AtomicDEX" Introduction</b>](/start-here/about-komodo-platform/product-introductions#AtomicDEX)

The [<b>AtomicDEX Tutorials</b>](/atomicdex/tutorials/) section contains a more thorough conceptual explanation of AtomicDEX.

Please consult our [Learning Path Outlines](/start-here/learning-launchpad/#introduction) section for more details on approaches to learning AtomicDEX from both a conceptual and technical perspective.

#### About AtomicDEX Setup

The AtomicDEX Setup section contains basic information about setting up and using an AtomicDEX-enabled environment.

#### About AtomicDEX Tutorials

The AtomicDEX Tutorials section contains various tutorials that provide instruction for AtomicDEX usage and creation.

For a walkthrough covering multiple tutorials in a targeted fashion, please see the [Learning Launchpad](/start-here/learning-launchpad/#introduction) section.

#### About AtomicDEX API

The AtomicDEX API section contains all available API commands.

These API commands can also be called Remote Procedure Calls (or RPCs) and are used to interact with the AtomicDEX daemon using a variety of languages.

Recently, a `komodefi-cli` binary has been introduced to simplify the process of [interacting with the AtomicDEX daemon from the command line](/atomicdex/tutorials/using-komodefi-cli-in-console/).
