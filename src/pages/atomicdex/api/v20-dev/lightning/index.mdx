# Lightning Network Methods

<Note>
Lightning methods are currently only available using the native AtomicDEX-API. WASM support should be available in late 2023.
</Note>


## Lightning Network Activation Tasks

- Initialise your lightning node with [task::enable_lightning::init](/atomicdex/api/v20-dev/lightning/activation#task::enable_lightning::init)
- Check the initialization status of the lightning node with [task::enable_lightning::status](/atomicdex/api/v20-dev/lightning/activation/task::enable_lightning::status)
- Cancel initialization process of the lightning node with [task::enable_lightning::cancel](/atomicdex/api/v20-dev/lightning/activation/task::enable_lightning::cancel)

<Note>
Any methods with a `task::` prefix will be linked to a numeric `task_id` value which is used to query the status or outcome of the task.

- Get details about a lightning payment with [lightning::payments::get_payment_details](/atomicdex/api/v20-dev/lightning/activation/lightning::payments::get_payment_details)
- Get a filtered list of lightning payments with [lightning::payments::list_payments_by_filter](/atomicdex/api/v20-dev/lightning/activation/lightning::payments::list_payments_by_filter)


## Lightning Network Error Responses

Check the details in `error_data` field to know which action is required (as detailed below).

<CollapsibleSection expandedText='Hide Errors' collapsedText='Show Errors'>

#### SomethingError

This error happens because. In this case, you need to do something.
The name of this error should be the same as the `error_type` in the response.

```json
{
  "mmrpc": "2.0",
  "error": "SomethingError",
  "error_path": "function_error_thrown_in",
  "error_trace": "trace_to_line_number:333]",
  "error_type": "SomethingError",
  "error_data": "Error data",
  "id": null
}
```

#### AnotherError

This error happens because. In this case, you need to do something.
The name of this error should be the same as the `error_type` in the response.
This and other errors all sit within the same `CollapsibleSection` tags.

```json
{
  "mmrpc": "2.0",
  "error": "Some info about the error which might offer insight into what went wrong",
  "error_path": "function_error_thrown_in",
  "error_trace": "trace_to_line_number:333]",
  "error_type": "AnotherError",
  "error_data": "Data about the error",
  "id": null
}
```
