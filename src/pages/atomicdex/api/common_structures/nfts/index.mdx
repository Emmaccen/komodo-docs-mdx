<DevComment>
  `verified` has no description. Related to [https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-whale-pranksy-pranked-by-fake-banksy-for-97-7-eth](https://cointelegraph.com/news/nft-whale-pranksy-pranked-by-fake-banksy-for-97-7-eth)? Who verifies it? I can see there are ways to verify on opensea etc, I assume Moralis incormoprates this.
  What are the other possible values for `transaction_type`?
  What is `operator`?
  What does `verified` mean?
