# Change Log


## v0.8.1 [Falkor]

* This update is mandatory and includes several security fixes, code refactoring, optimizations, and other improvements.
* Update Rust compiler to 1.69.
* Add notarisations specific unit tests.
* Refactoring the legacy code that is associated with PAX, KV, and ratification transactions has resulted in a slight decrease in block verification and overall synchronization time.
* Bump libcurl to 8.4.0 ([CVE-2023-38545](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-7xw9-w465-6x42), [CVE-2023-38546](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x3qx-m3c2-qfhx) fix).
* Fix the value pools (sprout, sapling) calculation issue.
* Minor fixes and updates.


## v0.8.0-beta1 [Viserion]

* This is a mandatory update, Komodo Season 7 HF planned on height `3484958` for KMD, and timestamp `1688132253` (`Fri Jun 30 2023 13:37:33 GMT+0000`) for assetchains. All wallets/nodes should be updated to the latest (`0.8.0`) software to continue following mainnet.
* Reduce AUR 5% -> 0.01% (start from S7), as it announced in [KIP-0001](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/kips/blob/main/kip-0001.mediawiki).
* Memory Usage Improvement: The memory usage of `komodod` has been reduced by not keeping Equihash solutions for all block headers in memory.
* Node Startup Performance Improvements.
* Security fixes.
* Upgrade project dependencies (libevent).
* Add `z_gettreestate` rpc.
* Minor fixes and updates.


## v0.7.2 [Longpan]

* This is a mandatory update, Komodo Season 6 HF planned on height 2963330 for KMD, and timestamp 1656077853 (Fri Jun 24 2022 13:37:33 GMT+0000) for assetchains. All wallets/nodes should be updated to the latest (0.7.2) software to continue following mainnet.
* Fix build with new glibc 2.34 on Linux platforms.
* Fix unoptimized depends build (bdb, boost, protobuf, zeromq).
* Remove Verus (VRSC) legacy code: VerusHash, VerusHash 1.1, Verus POS/stake, etc. Chains which used VerusHash as primary algo, like LUMBER will be incompatible with new version of daemon.
* Code refactoring. Perfomance boost on some operations.
* Restore -exchange command line arg for an exchanges (this will disable interest/reward calculations and will set nLockTime in newly created transactions to zero).
* Fix / refactor komodo_block_prg and komodo_block_unlocktime internals logic, get rid of VerusHash usage in it. Starting from this release all chains using -ac_timeunlockfrom, -ac_timeunlockto, -ac_timelockgte will be incompatible with new daemon (there was no well-known public blockchains using these features). Newly created blockchains (ACs) using these parameters will work without any limitations on 0.7.2 and higher versions of software.
* hf22 / hfnet consensus changes and fixes, related to well-known issues of long-gaps between blocks, disappearing txes from mempool in-case of big gaps between blocks, etc. These changes aimed to improve the network stability, help to get rid of such gaps, and make txes propagation more reliable and stable.
* Minor fixes and updates.
* version bump
